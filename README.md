# Assembly Problems

## Overview

This project consists of multiple separate problems, each involving different functionalities and challenges implemented in assembly language. Below is a brief description of each problem and its respective components.

## File Structure

- **simple.asm**: A basic assembly file, containing a simple problem related to assembly language syntax and structure.
- **run_procs.asm**: Implements the logic for managing and running processes.
- **sort_procs.asm**: Contains the sorting logic for processes, potentially ordering them based on priority, PID, or other parameters.
- **checkers.asm**: Implements the checkers game, including the game board, piece movement, and win condition.

## Problem Details

### Problem 1: Process Management and Sorting
This problem focuses on assembly-level process management and sorting. The files involved are:

#### run_procs.asm
The `run_procs.asm` file simulates the management of different processes, likely simulating how a system handles running multiple processes. This can include operations such as:

- Starting processes.
- Managing process states.
- Executing and tracking processes.

#### sort_procs.asm
The `sort_procs.asm` file is designed to sort processes, which could involve tasks like:

- Sorting by process IDs (PID).
- Sorting by process priorities or other attributes.
- Implementing an efficient sorting algorithm in assembly to handle process management tasks.

### Problem 2: Checkers Game
The `checkers.asm` file contains the logic for the checkers game, including:

- Initializing a checkers board.
- Validating moves.
- Handling player turns and game logic.
- Checking for win conditions and game-ending scenarios.
