# Assembly Problems

## Overview

This project consists of multiple separate problems, each involving different functionalities and challenges implemented in assembly language. Below is a brief description of each problem and its respective components.

## File Structure

- **simple.asm**: A basic assembly file, containing a simple problem related to assembly language syntax and structure.
- **run_procs.asm**: Implements the logic for managing and running processes.
- **sort_procs.asm**: Contains the sorting logic for processes, potentially ordering them based on priority, PID, or other parameters.
- **checkers.asm**: Implements the checkers game, including the game board, piece movement, and win condition.
- **reverse_vowels.asm**: Implements the logic for reversing vowels in a string.
- **pwd.asm**: Simulates the `pwd` command to print the current working directory.

## Problem Details

### Problem 1: Process Management and Sorting
This problem focuses on assembly-level process management and sorting. The files involved are:

#### run_procs.asm
The `run_procs.asm` file simulates the management of different processes, likely simulating how a system handles running multiple processes. This can include operations such as:

- Starting processes.
- Managing process states.
- Executing and tracking processes.

#### sort_procs.asm
The `sort_procs.asm` file is designed to sort processes, which could involve tasks like:

- Sorting by process IDs (PID).
- Sorting by process priorities or other attributes.
- Implementing an efficient sorting algorithm in assembly to handle process management tasks.

### Problem 2: Checkers Game
The `checkers.asm` file contains the logic for the checkers game, including:

- Initializing a checkers board.
- Validating moves.
- Handling player turns and game logic.
- Checking for win conditions and game-ending scenarios.

### Problem 3: Reverse Vowels in a String
The `reverse_vowels.asm` file implements a solution for the problem of reversing vowels in a string. This involves:

- Identifying vowels in the string
- Swapping the positions of the vowels while keeping the positions of non-vowel characters unchanged.

### Problem 4: Print Working Directory (pwd)
The `pwd.asm` file simulates the functionality of the Unix `pwd` command. This problem involves:

- Retrieving the current working directory.
- Displaying the directory path to the user, similar to how the `pwd` command works in a Unix-like terminal.
